# Google Developer Groups in Qassim University: Data Analysis Bootcamp

This section showcases my work from the 3-day Data Analysis Bootcamp provided by Google Developer Groups at Qassim University. 
I gained hands-on experience with the entire data analysis workflow, from understanding data types to performing exploratory data analysis.

# What I learned
- Fundamentals: I gained a solid understanding of data types, the roles of a data analyst vs. an AI engineer, and key concepts like data mining and cleaning.
- Practical Skills: I applied my knowledge practically using Google Colab and essential Python libraries.
- Data Storytelling: I learned to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find insights and create effective visualizations to tell a story with data.

  #Project files
  - [Day 1](Data_Science_Bootcamp/Day_1/): These text files encompass my notes taken during the lecture, as the lecture was a short one given it was an introduction to Data Analysis
  - [Day 2](Data_Science_Bootcamp/Day_2/): This Google Colab notebook contains my work on data cleaning and preparations. It shows my ability to handle raw datasets and prepare them for analysis
  - [Day 3](Data_Science_Bootcamp/Day_3/): This notebook showcases my final project where I performed a full EDA. It includes the charts I generated from the cleaned data
 

# Skills & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
