Today's goal we will use the dataset that we cleaned and turn it into something useful (data analysis).

EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

Famous questions to start analysis: Which is more or less? if x is changed what happens to y? What's the percentage of x compared to y?

Some chart types:
Histogram → distribution of one numeric variable

Bar Chart → compare categories

Box Plot → summary of distribution (median, spread, outliers)

Scatter Plot → relationship between two numeric variables

Heatmap → visualize correlation/matrix values

Choose based on project type

Causation does not mean correlation, sometimes connections are random even though it seems logical

Common mistakes:
- Small sample size
- Choosing pretty charts/diagrams over something clear
- Meaningless numbers (Agent column it was ID "string" not numbers)
