1. Types of Data

Structured data → organized in rows/columns (databases, Excel sheets). Easy to search/analyze.

Semi-structured data → not fully organized but has tags/markers (JSON, XML, log files).

Unstructured data → no fixed format (photos, videos, audio, free text). Harder to process, needs AI tools (like NLP for text, CV for images).

2. How to Look at Data (Analyst vs AI Engineer)

Data Analyst → looks for trends, insights, and patterns to support decisions. Works with tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau.

AI Engineer → prepares and uses data to train models, focusing on algorithms, feature engineering, and machine learning.

3. Data Mining vs Data Analysis

Data mining → discovering hidden patterns in large datasets (more automatic, exploratory).

Data analysis → testing hypotheses, answering specific questions (more manual, guided).

4. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning → labeled data (input → output). Example: predicting house prices, spam email detection.

Unsupervised learning → unlabeled data. Model finds structure/patterns itself. Example: clustering customers by behavior, grouping similar images.

5. Data Cleaning

Process of fixing and preparing raw data so it’s usable for analysis or AI models.

6. Dataset Issues

Outliers → extreme values (can distort results).

Missing data → gaps in dataset (e.g., no age recorded).

Bias → skewed data that doesn’t represent reality (e.g., dataset mostly from one group).

Duplicates → repeated entries that can affect results.

7. Examples of Cleaning/Preparation

Normalization → adjusting values to a standard range so features are treated fairly by algorithms.

Feature selection → choosing the most relevant variables to reduce noise and improve performance. (not using peoples names in datasets)	

Encoding → converting categorical data to numbers (e.g., "Male/Female" → 0/1).

Remove null/duplicate data → delete or fill missing entries, and drop duplicate rows.
