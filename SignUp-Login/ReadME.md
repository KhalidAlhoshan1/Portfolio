Simple Login Program

This is a small Python program that lets a user sign up with a username and password, saves the information in a JSON file, and then allows the user to log in next time.

How it works
- If no user data is saved, the program asks you to enter a username and password and then saves them.  
- If user data is already saved, the program asks you to log in.  
- It tells you if the username or password is wrong.  
- If both are correct, it welcomes you back.

Before running the program make sure to change the path for JSON file to your desired location on line 6 and 11
